        <p>Presentation is a speach or talk which a new idea or piece of work as shown an explaind.</p>
        <h2 class="presentation-sub-title">Process of Presentation</h2>
        <p>You should explain your presentation in all semester.<br>The teacher must give you some project/topic and you have to explain this idea how project was made(Topic was explane).<br>Presentation also have 5 marks in final exam.</p>

          <h2>Top Tips for Effective Presentation</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="presentation-top-tip-text">
          <ol>
            <li>Show your Passion and Connect with you Audience</li>
            <p>It’s hard to be relaxed and be yourself when you’re nervous.But time and again, the great presenters say that the most important thing is to connect with your audience, and the best way to do that is to let your passion for the subject shine through.Be honest with the audience about what is important to you and why it matters.Be enthusiastic and honest, and the audience will respond.</p>
            <li>Use your Body Langauge Too</li>
            <p>It has been estimated that more than three quarters of communication is non-verbal.That means that as well as your tone of voice, your body language is crucial to getting your message across. Make sure that you are giving the right messages: body language to avoid includes crossed arms, hands held behind your back or in your pockets, and pacing the stage.Make your gestures open and confident, and move naturally around the stage, and among the audience too, if possible</p>
            <li>Keep it Simple</li>
            <p>When planning your presentation, you should always keep in mind the question.<br>
                i  ) What is the key message (or three key points) for my audience to take away.<br>
                ii ) You should be able to communicate that key message very briefly.<br>
                iii) Some experts recommend a 30-second ‘elevator summary’, others that you can write it on the back of a business card, or say it in no more than 15 words.<br>
            </p>
            <li>Focus on your Audience’s Needs</li>
            <p>Your presentation needs to be built around what your audience is going to get out of the presentation.As you prepare the presentation, you always need to bear in mind what the audience needs and wants to know, not what you can tell them.While you’re giving the presentation, you also need to remain focused on your audience’s response, and react to that</p>
            <li>10-20-30 Rule</li>
            <p>This is a slideshow rule offered by Guy Kawasaki. This rule states that a powerpoint slide should have no more than 10 slides, last no longer than 20 minutes and have no text less than 30 point font. He says it doesn’t matter whether your idea will revolutionize the world, you need to spell out the important nuggets in a few minutes minutes, a couple slides and a several words a slide.</p>
            <li>Slow Down</li>
            <p>Nervous and inexperienced speakers tend to talk way to fast. Consciously slow your speech down and add pauses for emphasis.</p>
            <li>Eye Contact</li>
            <p>Match eye contact with everyone in the room. I’ve also heard from salespeople that you shouldn’t focus all your attention on the decision maker since secretaries and assistants in the room may hold persuasive sway over their boss.</p>
            <li>15 Word Summary</li>
            <p>Can you summarize your idea in fifteen words? If not, rewrite it and try again. Speaking is an inefficient medium for communicating information, so know what the important fifteen words are so they can be repeated.</p>
            <li>20-20 Rule</li>
            <p> Another suggestion for slideshows. This one says that you should have twenty slides each lasting exactly twenty seconds. The 20-20 Rule forces you to be concise and to keep from boring people</p>
            <li>Speeches are About Storie</li>
            <p>If your presentation is going to be a longer one, explain your points through short stories, quips and anecdotes. Great speakers know how to use a story to create an emotional connection between ideas for the audience.</p>
            <li>Project Your Voice</li>
            <p>Nothing is worse than a speaker you can’t hear. Even in the high-tech world of microphones and amplifiers, you need to be heard. Projecting your voice doesn’t mean yelling, rather standing up straight and letting your voice resonate on the air in your lungs rather than in the throat to produce a clearer sound</p>
            <li>Do Apologize if You’re Wrong</li>
            <p>One caveat to the above rule is that you should apologize if you are late or shown to be incorrect. You want to seem confident, but don’t be a jerk about it.</p>
            <li>Put Yourself in the Audience</li>
            <p>When writing a speech, see it from the audiences perspective. What might they not understand? What might seem boring? Use WIIFM (What’s In It For Me) to guide you.</p>
